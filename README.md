17)
This Java program takes user input for an array of integers and finds the maximum (greatest) element in the array.

🛠️ How It Works

Ask the user how many elements the array will have.

Take input for each element of the array.

Use a variable check to keep track of the largest number.

Compare each element of the array with check.

After the loop ends, print the greatest number.

📥 Example Input
Enter the Number of element in the Array: 
5
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
12
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
45
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
7
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
89
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
23

📤 Example Output
Greatest Number in the Array is: 89

18)⬇️ minimumarrayelem
📌 Description

This Java program finds the minimum (smallest) element in a user-input array.

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters the size of the array.

The program takes input for each element.

A variable check is used to track the smallest value.

The program loops through the array and updates check whenever a smaller element is found.

Finally, it prints the minimum element.

📥 Example Input
Enter the Number of element in the Array: 
5
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
12
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
45
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
7
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
89
Enter the Number of Elements in the Array: 
23

📤 Example Output
Smallest Number in the Array is: 7
